# Solvers

There are two solvers: `SignedHeatTetSolver` solves for SDFs on a tetrahedralized domain, and  `SignedHeatGridSolver` solves for SDFs on gridded domain. Both solvers assume the domain is rectangular, though [future releases](https://github.com/nzfeng/signed-heat-python/issues/2) may consider arbitrary domains.

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatTetSolver(verbose: bool = True)`"

    Construct an SDF solver that acts on a tet-meshed domain.

    - `verbose`: If `True`, print status updates during solves.

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatGridSolver(verbose: bool = True)`"

    Construct an SDF solver that acts on a gridded domain.

    - `verbose`: If `True`, print status updates during solves.

To improve performance, operators and spatial discretizations are only built as necessary, and re-used in future computations if the underlying discretization hasn't changed. This means future computations can be significantly faster than the initial solve (which includes, for example, tet mesh construction and matrix factorization.)

## Signed distance to triangle and polygon meshes

**Example:**
```python
import signed_heat_method as shm

V, F = # your mesh

# Initalize tet mesh solver
tet_solver = shm.SignedHeatTetSolver(verbose=True) # print all messages

# Solve!
sdf_tets = tet_solver.compute_distance_to_mesh(V, F)

# Solve on a regular grid instead.
grid_solver = shm.SignedHeatGridSolver(verbose=True)
sdf_grid = grid_solver.compute_distance_to_mesh(V, F)
```

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatTetSolver.compute_distance_to_mesh(V: np.ndarray, F: list[list[int]], options: dict = {})  -> np.ndarray`"

    Solve for an SDF on a tet mesh, to the mesh represented by the vertex array `V` and face array `F`.

    - `V` is a (n_vertices, 3) NumPy array of 3D vertex positions, where the i-th row gives the 3D position of the i-th vertex.
    - `F` is a list of lists; each sublist represents a polygonal mesh face of arbitrary degree, using 0-indexed vertices.

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatGridSolver.compute_distance_to_mesh(V: np.ndarray, F: list[list[int]], options: dict = {}) -> np.ndarray`"

    Solve for an SDF on a tet mesh, to the mesh represented by the vertex array `V` and face array `F`.

    - `V` is a (n_vertices, 3) NumPy array of 3D vertex positions, where the i-th row gives the 3D position of the i-th vertex.
    - `F` is a list of lists; each sublist represents a polygonal mesh face of arbitrary degree, using 0-indexed vertices.

Both `compute_distance_to_mesh()` functions take an optional argument called `options`, which is a dictionary with the following possible entries:

| Field | Default value |Meaning|
|---|---|---|
| `#!python level_set_constraint`| `#!python "ZeroSet"` | Whether to apply level set constraints, with options "ZeroSet", "None", "Multiple", corresponding to preservation of the input surface as the zero set, as multiple level sets (one for each surface component), or no constraints, respectively. |
| `#!python t_coef`| `1` | Sets the time used for short-time heat flow. Generally you don't have to change this.|
| `#!python bbox_min`| | The 3D position of the minimum corner of the computational domain, which is assumed to be an axis-aligned rectangular prism. If not specified, the size of the domain will be automatically computed so as to encompass the input source geometry. |
| `#!python bbox_max`| | The 3D position of the maximum corner of the computational domain. |
| `#!python resolution`| `#!python np.array([2**5, 2**5, 2**5])` | 3D vector specifying the tet or grid spacing, with larger values indicating more refinement. If solving on a grid, this corresponds to the number of nodes along each dimension. Default values are $2^{5}$. |
| `#!python rebuild`| `True` | If `True`, (re)build the underlying tet mesh or grid domain. This will induce the solver to re-factorize the matrices involved in the solve.|

## Signed distance to point clouds

**Example:**
```python
import signed_heat_method as shm

P, N = # your point cloud, with normals

# Initalize tet mesh solver
tet_solver = shm.SignedHeatTetSolver(verbose=True) # print all messages

# Solve!
sdf_tets = tet_solver.compute_distance_to_point_cloud(P, N)

# Solve on a regular grid instead.
grid_solver = shm.SignedHeatGridSolver(verbose=True)
sdf_grid = grid_solver.compute_distance_to_point_cloud(P, N)
```

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatTetSolver.compute_distance_to_mesh(P: np.ndarray, N: np.ndarray, options: dict = {}) -> np.ndarray`"

    Solve for an SDF on a tet mesh, to the point cloud represented by the point positions array `P` and point normals `N`.

    - `P` is a (n_points, 3) NumPy array of 3D point positions, where the i-th row gives the 3D position of the i-th point.
    - `N` is a (n_points, 3) NumPy array of 3D normal vectors, where |P| = number of points in the source point cloud.

??? func "`#!python SignedHeatGridSolver.compute_distance_to_mesh(P: np.ndarray, N: np.ndarray, options: dict = {}) -> np.ndarray`"

    Solve for an SDF on a grid, to the point cloud represented by the point positions array `P` and point normals `N`.

    - `P` is a (n_points, 3) NumPy array of 3D point positions, where the i-th row gives the 3D position of the i-th point.
    - `N` is a (n_points, 3) NumPy array of 3D normal vectors, where |P| = number of points in the source point cloud.

| `#!python bbox_max`| | The 3D position of the maximum corner of the computational domain. |
| `#!python resolution`| `#!python np.array([2**5, 2**5, 2**5])` | 3D vector specifying the tet or grid spacing, with larger values indicating more refinement. If solving on a grid, this corresponds to the number of nodes along each dimension. Default values are $2^{5}$. |
| `#!python rebuild`| `True` | If `True`, (re)build the underlying tet mesh or grid domain. This will induce the solver to re-factorize the matrices involved in the solve.|
